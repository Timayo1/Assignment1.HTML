    <h1>First Assignment</h1>
    <p>My first day at the NIFES Bootcamp was quite intresting and insightful. Our instructor explained what Web Development is all about, he told us that the key to being a professional web developer is creativity and thinking outside the box. </p>
    <p>I would really want to build a professional website at the end of this Bootcamp. I will also want to make use of whatever i've learnt in the entrepreneurial world</p>
